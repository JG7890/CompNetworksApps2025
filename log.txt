    Bonus mark port number task
    
    Implemented hostname dissecting to check for and connect to specified port numbers in URL.

    Small fix
    
    originServerSocket.connect() uses address rather than hostname. Did not change functionality but technically more correct.

    Improved response code handling
    
    301 responses are cacheable and 302, 404 responses and more are only cacheable if cache-control: public is specified in the response. Updated code to account for the full list of cacheable by default response codes, where the non-cacheable ones will be allowed if cache-control: public.

    Expires header handling
    
    First bonus mark task. Handles Expires header. Header only relevant if Cache-Control:max-age was not present, if so, compares Expires date to current date to check if response is stale.

    Fixed bug in header handling
    
    Token directives were not being matched to if a comma (',') was present after the directive. (for example 'no-cache' and 'no-cache,' are both possible in a header's directive list depending on whether present in the final position or not)

    Checks client request max-age
    
    Now checks headers in client's request for Cache-Control: max-age to compare this value with the date as well as the cached response max-age. max-age directive seems to be fully working now with requests and responses.

    Removed unnecessary header checks
    
    Got slightly confused. Proxy does not need to check for no-store/no-cache/private when checking the cached response before sending to client, as I have already made sure the proxy will not cache responses including those directives. (This code section handles Date and max-age and checks if cached response is okay to send, it is not looking at the client's request itself as my previous commit comment implied.)

    Check if request accepts cached response
    
    Checking for headers Date and Cache-Control to verify that the client request is okay with the cached response. Max-age directive used to compare current and cached response date.

    First header parsing
    
    Parsing headers to check whether or not to cache the response received from origin server, including Cache-Control and 301/302 response codes, so far.

    Responds to client with cached data
    
    Responds to client with cached data correctly with new cache implementation. Image caching now works and so should all file types.

    Implemented better caching
    
    Response line and headers are now cached in their own file (the original one), with full response in its own file, allowing the original file to work with the readlines() in the skeleton code for all responses including image file responses (no longer have to try to translate all the random binary content into strings for no reason).

    Make sure empty caches are not sent to client
    
    Empty cache files are not sent and instead a request is sent to origin server. This will likely help for when I implement the removing of expired caches.

    Fixed cache response issues
    
    Firstly, fixed response by converting the cache data (which is in a list) into a string, and encoding it. Secondly I had to make sure variable cacheData was set to the unencoded cacheData as a string instead of list (before being encoded) so it would print properly in the skeleton code without erroring.

    Request to origin server corrected
    
    Figured out how to do this properly. The URI is the resource part, and the hostname header is the host. Leave out host name in request line. Checked the RFC to verify this. The URI is sent as an 'absolute path'.
